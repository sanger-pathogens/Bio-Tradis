INSTALLATION NOTES

Bio-Tradis requires the following external software packages:

smalt (tested version 0.7.6) https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/
htslib samtools (tested version 1.2, htslib version 1.2.1) http://www.htslib.org/

NOTE: htslib samtools should be softlinked to "samtools-htslib", 
which should be somewhere in your path. This is to avoid clashes
on systems containing multiple version of samtools. E.g.:

sudo ln -s /usr/bin/samtools-htslib /path/to/htslib/samtools/install

Perl version tested 5.14.2. Perl scripts require the following modules, which can be installed via CPAN:
Text::CSV
Moose
Getout::Long
File::Basename
Bio::SeqIO
Data::Dumper

R version tested 3.0.0. R scripts require the following libraries, which can be installed via CRAN:
edgeR
getopt
MASS 

Once these requirements have been installed, Bio-Tradis should be added to your path:

export PERL5LIB=/my/path/to/Bio-Tradis/lib:$PERL5LIB
export PATH=/my/path/to/Bio-Tradis/bin:$PATH

These lines (or similar for CSH) can be added to your bash profile.
